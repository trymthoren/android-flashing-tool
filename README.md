## Overview

The Android Flashing Tool is a Python script that provides a simple and user-friendly GUI-based interface for flashing files onto Android devices using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). This tool is designed to work with a wide range of Android devices and can be customized for different flashing scenarios. It simplifies the flashing process and is particularly useful for those who are not comfortable with command-line operations.

## Features

- User-friendly GUI for file selection and flashing.
- Support for various Android devices.
- Customizable ADB commands for different flashing scenarios.
- Easy-to-use interface for both beginners and advanced users.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your computer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Android Debug Bridge (ADB) installed and configured on your system. ADB is part of the Android SDK Platform Tools, which you can download from the [official Android website](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
- USB debugging enabled on your Android device. You can typically find this option in the 'Developer Options' section of your device's settings.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/trymthoren/android-flashing-tool.git
  2. Run the Script:
     python android_flash_tool.py
     This will open the GUI interface for the flashing tool.
  3. Select a File:
     Click the "Select File" button to open a file dialog. Choose the file you want to flash onto your Android device (e.g., a firmware, custom ROM, or recovery image).
  4. Flash the File:
     After selecting the file, click the "Flash File" button. The tool will perform the following actions:
      ◦ Reboot your Android device into bootloader mode using ADB.
      ◦ Wait for the device to enter bootloader mode (you can adjust the sleep duration in the script if needed).
      ◦ Flash the selected file onto the device using ADB.
  5. Completion:
     Once the flashing process is complete, the tool will display "Flashing done!" in the GUI.
Important Considerations
    • Backup Data: Always make a backup of your device's data before flashing any files. Flashing can result in data loss.
    • File Compatibility: Ensure that the file you are flashing is compatible with your specific Android device model.
    • Customization: Depending on your specific use case, you may need to customize the ADB commands used in the script (e.g., if you are flashing a recovery image, the command may differ).
    • Device Drivers: Ensure that the necessary drivers for your Android device are installed on your computer.
